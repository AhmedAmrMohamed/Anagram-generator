    <h1>How do we know if two words are anagrams?</h1><br>
    <p>there are couple of easy ways to<p>
      <dl>
        <dt>sort and compare</dt>
          <dd>we can sort the letters of the two words alphabiticly and check if they are equal</dd>
          <dt>count and go</dt>
          <dd>simply count the the frequency of every letter in the two words.</dd>
        </dl>
      <p>
        the first method takes <span class='O'>O(n)</span> while the second takes <span class='O'>O(nlg(n))</span>. which is ok in most cases but not in ours.
        because we are trying to find an anagram for a word. so if we went over every word in our dcitionary and check is they are Anagrams
        we end up with <span class='O'>O(n*m)</span>.

            <p>We do know that evey number can be factored to a unique set of prime numbers<p>
            <p>We will use that into our advantage</p>
            <p>First map every letter in the alpabet to a prime number. then go throuh your dictionary and calculate the product of every word by multiplying its letters.</P>
            <p>you will notice that angrams  have the same product</p>
            <p>Now store the result in a hashtable where the key is the product and the value is the word itself</p>
            <p>Now we want to find all anagrams to a word. simply caluculate it's product and get all the words of the same product<p>
